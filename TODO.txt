Add another mode (sorry!): //S- and //S+ for stuff that students should remove in the exercise
and thus should be omitted from the solution (S-). ALAS, this would require rewriting the 
Solution files as well as the student starting version files, which is just too dangerous!
This would require us to go to the next level: Build both fooSolution and foo from fooMaster

Make more junit tests.

Run diff(1) on files that report changes.
