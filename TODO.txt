Add another mode (sorry!): //S- and //S+ for stuff that students should remove in the exercise
and thus should be omitted from the solution (S-). ALAS, this would require rewriting the 
Solution files as well as the student starting version files, which is just too dangerous!

Make more junit tests.

Run diff(1) on files that report changes.

Maybe: Build both fooSolution and foo from e.g., fooMaster
