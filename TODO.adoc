= MakeHandsOn Bug list / TODO list

Option to remove-by-default each top-level project directory.

Run diff(1) on files that report changes; Generate HTML hints from the diffs.

There ought to be a way to build several related projects from the same tree.
For example, a main solution and a bonus solution.
This is left as a post-1.0-RELEASE proposal.

Add another mode (sorry!): //S- and //S+ for stuff that students should remove in the exercise
and thus should be omitted from the solution (S-). ALAS, this would require rewriting the 
Solution files as well as the student starting version files, which is just too dangerous!
This would require us to go to the next level: Build both fooSolution and foo from fooMaster

Make more junit tests.
