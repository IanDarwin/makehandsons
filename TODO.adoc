Option to remove-by-default each top-level project (non-solution) directory.

Option to omit generating certain folders, so you can have ex31solution and ex31bonussolution and only
wind up with ex31.

Run diff(1) on files that report changes; Generate HTML hints from the diffs.

There ought to be a way to build several related projects from the same tree.
For example, a main solution and a bonus solution.
Or several solutions form the same codebase.
Think cpp's #ifdef, m4, etc.

Add another mode (sorry!): //K- and //K+ for stuff that students should remove in the exercise
and thus should be omitted from the solution. ALAS, this would require rewriting the 
Solution files as well as the student starting version files, which is just too dangerous!
This would require us to go to the next level: Build both fooSolution and foo from fooMaster

Make more junit tests.
