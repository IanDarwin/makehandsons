This makes the student todo exercise directories directly from the solutions.

This module performs various substitutions on files. It creates a copy
of the directory it is started in, with the filename transformed by
removing "solution" from it. This is baked into the code.

As well, the following line-based changes are baked into the code:

	//- through to //+ inclusive are DELETED from the output

As well, the following text-based changes are made, only to file
whose extentions are listed in XXX.
The texts are loaded from a properties file to be easy to change.
The input format is: regex=replacement
The rough initial list looks like this:

	//T text -> // TODO text
	//H text -> //*HINT* text
	//R text -> text
	"solution" -> ""
	/usr/home/ian -> C:/
