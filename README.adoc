Introduction to MakeHandsOn

$Id$

This makes the student todo exercise directories directly from the solutions.

This module performs various substitutions on files. It creates a copy
of the first directory into the second (which must not exist),
making all the line-based changes shown below.

MARKING UP THE SOLUTION VERSION OF FILES

The following line-based changes are baked into the code:

	//- through to //+ inclusive are DELETED from the output
	
Other changes are configurable (see below). The following are currently
provided:

1) Mark TODO lines with //T instead of TODO so the solution doesn't 
show in Tasks Window in Eclipse. //T (with a space after!) gets turned 
into // TODO

2) //H  becomes // *HINT*

3) Use //R for replacement variables, that is, placeholders for stuff that gets cut
//R

4) Remove "solution" from filenames in config files (so be warned: don't
use the word 'solution' unless you mean it to go away in the non-solution.
This sounds painful but is required so that the Eclipse .project/.classpath
files will work

5) Finally, we replace absolute paths. At present /usr/home/ian or
/home/ian get turned into C:/.  If you are not Ian and have used any
absolute paths, you might have to change the properties file as
discussed below.

Changes are made only to files whose extentions are listed in 
SUB_TEXT_FILE_EXTENS in the program, which currently includes
the filename endings 
		".java",
		".jsp",
		".html",
		".project",
		".properties",
		".xhtml", and
		".xml".

Note that no changes will be made in directories named CVS or .metadata.

CUSTOMIZING

The text substitions are loaded from a properties file to be easy to change, but
if you do the documenation above will not strictly apply!

The input format is: regex=replacement.  If you are determined to change it,
consult the included properties file to see the examples.

You can change this by editing makehandson.properties AND
re-generating the Jar file (see GENERATING below). You could probably
just put the new jar on your CLASSPATH ahead of the jar file, but this
is not documented.

GENERATING THE NON_SOLUTION VERSIONS FROM THE MARKED-UP SOLUTIONS

Each folder should be named foosolution, e.g., ex41solution. This will create ex41.

Then run "java -jar makehandson.jar *solution" in the crsXXX
directory. This will create ex11 from ex11solution, and so on.

REBUILDING THE PROGRAM

The source file for makehandson is an Eclipse project. Open it in Eclipse
and make any changes (this step is required as it will also compile the files!!).

Then run "ant jar" and it will create a Jar file in the project directory.

MODIFYING THE PROGRAM

If you want to modify the program (you probably shouldn't, ...), you can get it
from my public CVS repository, or I can mail you a copy. The former way allows
you to get updates automatically, while the latter does not.

Enjoy.
